Run Cubic
Select a directory to store all data
Select the ubuntu iso you desire
Under the "Custom Disk..." column (right-side column), do the following:
	In the "Filename" field, delete "ubuntu-" and add "advantech-" (ie my final result was "advantech-20.04.6-2023.04.17-desktop-amd64.iso")
	In the "Disk Name" field, add "Advantech-" in front of everything (ie my final result was Advantech-Ubuntu 20.04.6 2023.04.17 LTS "Custom Focal Fossa")
Once in the virtual environment, copy the following commands EXACTLY:


mkdir /etc/skel/.config/
mkdir /etc/skel/.config/autostart/
apt update
apt install gcc
nano /etc/skel/ExecuteScript.sh	***copy contents of ExecuteScript.sh***
nano /etc/skel/ProgramExecuteScript.c		***copy contents of ProgramExecuteScript.c***
chmod +x /etc/skel/ExecuteScript.sh
chown root /etc/skel/ExecuteScript.sh
chmod 4755 /etc/skel/ExecuteScript.sh
chmod +x /etc/skel/ProgramExecuteScript.c
chown root.root /etc/skel/ProgramExecuteScript.c
chmod 4755 /etc/skel/ProgramExecuteScript.c
cd /etc/skel/
gcc ProgramExecuteScript.c -o Program
chmod +x Program
chown root.root Program
chmod 4755 Program
cd ..
cd ..
cd ~
nano /etc/skel/.config/autostart/ExecuteScriptDesktop.desktop	***copy contents of ExecuteScriptDesktop.desktop***
chmod +x /etc/skel/.config/autostart/ExecuteScriptDesktop.desktop
chown root /etc/skel/.config/autostart/ExecuteScriptDesktop.desktop
chmod 4755 /etc/skel/.config/autostart/ExecuteScriptDesktop.desktop


Hit "Next" button to exit virtual environment
Unless you want to mess with installed/uninstalled packages, I would recommend just hitting "Next" button again
Hit "Next" button
I would stick with the default compression which is .gzip
Hit generate button
Once everything is done, copy the newly created iso to a USB stick
Plug USB stick into a machine with Windows on it
Copy iso from USB stick to somewhere on the machine
Use Rufus to burn the iso onto a different USB stick (do GPT scheme with FAT32 file system)
Take the burned USB stick and plug it into a machine with Linux on it
Run Gparted
In top right corner, select the /dev that your USB is (if you are unsure just look at the GB size)
Right click on the main partition and unmount it
Right click on the main partition and select the "Resize/Move" option
In the "Free Space Following" field, type anywhere from 1000-5000 (pending how much space is desired) and press enter button
Click the "Resize/Move" button
In the newly created space (labeled "unallocated"), right click and select the "New" option
Leave everything default, but change the file system field to fat32
Under the top menu, there will be a green checkmark; you MUST click this to apply the partition changes
Click green check mark and wait for changes to take place (can take anywhere from a few seconds to an hour)
After operations have completed, close out of Gparted, open your file explorer, right click on the USB stick and click the "Eject" option
Take your USB stick out and plug it back into a machine with Windows on it

Edit configuration files on the USB stick doing EXACTLY the following:
***Steps taken from askubuntu.com/questions/1231734/disable-ubuntu-20-04-disk-checkup-every-boot

	Open Windows File Explorer and click on the USB stick
	Click on the "boot" folder, then "grub" folder, then open "grub.cfg"
	Look for the line that says "set timeout"... change the number from whatever is default to 2 (the line should now read "set timeout=2")
	Below this "set timeout" line should be the default Ubuntu grub menu entry... delete "maybe-ubiquity" near the end of the line and type "fsck.mode=skip" in its place... the menu entry should look like the following after you have made the changes:
			
			
menuentry "Ubuntu" {
	set gfxpayload=keep
	linux	/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed fsck.mode=skip quiet splash ---
	initrd	/casper/initrd.lz
}
	
	
	Save all changes, then close "grub.cfg"
	Click on the USB stick again
	Click on the "isolinux" folder, then scroll to near the bottom and find "txt.cfg", then open "txt.cfg"
	In the first menu label entry listed, go to the end of the line that begins with "append" and add "fsck.mode=skip" before "quiet splash ---" ... the menu entry should now look like the following after you have made the changes:
	
	
menu label ^Try Ubuntu without installing
 kernel /casper/vmlinuz
 append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed initrd=/casper/initrd.lz boot=casper fsck.mode=skip quiet splash ---
	
	
	Save all changes, then close "txt.cfg"
	Click on the USB stick again
	Open "syslinux.cfg"
	Delete the contents of the file and replace with the following code:
	
		
default persistent
label persistent
  say Booting an Ubuntu Persistent session...
  kernel /casper/vmlinuz
  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper persistent initrd=/casper/initrd quiet splash noprompt --
		
		
	Save all changes, then close "syslinux.cfg"
	Right click on the USB stick and click the "Eject" option from the menu
	Take the USB stick out and it is now ready
